# Learning-Python-Asynchronous-Programming


This project simulates an asynchronous online shopping experience in Python. It demonstrates how different shopping actions—like browsing products, adding items to a cart, and processing payments—can be implemented using asynchronous programming with `asyncio`. This simulation involves random delays to mimic real-world wait times.

## Project Structure

- **online_shopping.py**: The main script containing asynchronous functions that represent each step of the online shopping process.

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.7 or later, as it utilizes `asyncio`, which comes built into modern versions of Python.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-shopping-simulation.git
