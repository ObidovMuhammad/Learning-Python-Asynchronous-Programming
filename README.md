# Learning-Python-Asynchronous-Programming


This project simulates an asynchronous online shopping experience in Python. It demonstrates how different shopping actions—like browsing products, adding items to a cart, and processing payments—can be implemented using asynchronous programming with `asyncio`. This simulation involves random delays to mimic real-world wait times.
